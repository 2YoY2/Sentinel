## ISSUE 101: Slow Internet (General)
If a customer reports slow internet, check the signal strength.
If signal < -80dBm, it is a coverage issue. Suggest a repeater.
If signal is good, ask to restart the box.

## ISSUE 105: Slow Internet in Zone B
Zone B has old infrastructure.
A common cause is OUTDATED FIRMWARE on the router.
Fix: Schedule a remote firmware update to version v2.0.
Also, check for "packet loss" in the logs.

## ISSUE 202: No Internet / Red Light
If the optical box shows a RED LIGHT, it means no signal from the street.
This usually means a cut cable or a disconnected patch cord.
Action: Schedule a level 2 technician intervention.
